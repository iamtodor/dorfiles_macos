First of all, thank you for such a great course!

It's one of the best course I buy and pass so far during all my careeer.

I'm not an English native speaker, so excuse me if I use an unappropriate words here. I don't aim to blame you or bring any negative here.

Personally, I learn a lot of stuff. And there more to come. I'm interested in more content.

I'm not sure if you could shift responsibility for promoting the course from yourself to your payable customers. It's sort of your business to create a catching promo movie, decent course, and to promote and ad your course. We are as a customers cannot be responsible about your income. You set the price - we agreed on it. To show my adherence, I mark this course 5/5 and I leave a pleasant review. I also would recommending this course to my macOS friends. But it's not that amount of audience you expect.

I'd recommend to you promote this course on reddit in an appropriate subreddit. I would definitely vote for that.

As you mentioned:
1. "price of the course might go up if I add future installments" - I'm totally up for paying for a parts. Its definitely worth it.
2. "with your support, I'll be able to make those future installments" - I can repost your post in any social media in order to promote it. Just leave the linkedin, twitter, reddit, basically any link and ask for support and repost.
